## Introduction
The Railway Ticket Booking System is an application designed to facilitate the process of booking, viewing, and canceling railway tickets. Utilizing Python, Streamlit, and MySQL, this system provides a user-friendly interface and a robust backend ensuring efficient and secure operations. By integrating database normalization techniques, the system achieves optimal data management, reducing redundancy and maintaining data integrity.

## Objectives
The primary objective of the Railway Ticket Booking System is to develop a reliable and efficient platform for users to book railway tickets online. The system aims to:
1. Provide a seamless and intuitive user interface for ticket booking, viewing, and cancellation.
2. Ensure data integrity and optimal database performance through normalization principles.
3. Offer secure and scalable solutions for handling user data and transactions.
4. Enable administrative control over train schedules, fare management, and user management.
5. Enhance the overall user experience by minimizing booking errors and simplifying the ticket management process.

## Modules
1. **User Registration and Authentication**:
    - Sign-Up: Allows new users to create accounts.
    - Login: Enables existing users to log in securely.
    - Password Management: Provides functionalities for password recovery and changes.

2. **Ticket Booking**:
